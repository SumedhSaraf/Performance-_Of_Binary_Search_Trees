# Performance-_Of_Binary_Search_Trees
### This Project deals with using BST data structure as a model to represent memory block usage.
- Project code deals mainly with simulation of memory management by generating requests for memory of different sizes. 
- Requested blocks are retained for a certain timeframe and returned accordingly
